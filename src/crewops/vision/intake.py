"""Photos into the crew desk: sick notes, roster swaps, certificates, aircraft defects, and
disruption notices (a departures board, a gate screen, an ATC delay message), and conditions at
the airport (fog, flooding, a closed gate).

Every photo passes the same gates, and the code decides what happens, not the model:

1. **Picture quality**, measured from the pixels: blur and darkness ask for a reshoot before
   any model is called.
2. **What is in it**: Muse Spark reads the photo into a fixed form for its kind. The form has
   no free text the rest of the system acts on.
3. **The decision**, in code:

   ======================  ==============================================================
   ``rejected``            not the kind of thing expected (a selfie as a sick note)
   ``reshoot``             unreadable or unclear, with the reason
   ``confirm``             the person or aircraft it names does not match, or is ambiguous
   ``draft``               a proposal a person must confirm; nothing is changed by a photo
   ======================  ==============================================================

For a defect, SAM 3.1 then locates the damage named by the form, and the confidence level is
built from independent signals (picture quality, the model's view of the photo, whether SAM
found the damage, whether the tail number matches) rather than the model's own score.
