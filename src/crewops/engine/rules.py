"""The nine duty rules.

Each check returns a ``Finding`` that carries the numbers behind it, not just pass or fail:
"60h/7d exceeded by 1h20m on 5 Nov" is something a controller can act on, "illegal" is not.

The checks only read a ``CrewState`` and the duty days being judged, so they are tested without
any store. Limits come from a ``RuleBook`` built from the rule parameters in the data, so an
admin can tighten a limit without a code change.

The rule set follows the shape of Indian flight duty time limitations (a shorter duty period
and a two-landing cap when a duty touches the night, a weekly rest of two clear days, and rest
at least as long as the duty before it), simplified for a demo.
