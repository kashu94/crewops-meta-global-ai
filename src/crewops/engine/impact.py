"""What a disruption does to the roster, and the cheapest way to repair all of it at once.

Three questions, each answered from the rules alone:

* An absence: which seats does it empty? ``absence_gaps`` lists every trip the person is
  rostered on in the dates given, with the passengers behind each seat.
* A delay: who does it push over a limit? ``delay_impact`` re-judges everyone on the trip with
  the late departure, including the rest they now owe before their next trip.
* Several empty seats: what is the cheapest legal way to fill them together? ``joint_cover``
  searches the combinations so nobody is used twice, where filling each seat on its own could
  pick the same standby captain for two trips.
