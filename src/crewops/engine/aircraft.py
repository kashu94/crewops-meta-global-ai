"""What the desk can do when an aircraft goes out of service.

Holding every flight until the aircraft is back only makes sense for a short outage. Before
that, the operation looks for another aircraft of the same type that is free for the whole run
of flights it would take over (out and back, so it ends where it started), then for one of the
spare aircraft kept at the hub, and only then holds or cancels. Crew stay with their flights:
a swap to the same type keeps every duty, rating and time the same.
