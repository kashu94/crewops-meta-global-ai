"""Who can cover an empty seat, what each choice costs, and why everyone else is out.

``find_cover`` judges every crew member of the airline who could sit in the seat and returns
the legal ones ranked by cost. A controller works through choices in a fixed order, and the
result keeps it:

1. Own-rank crew: standby callouts, day-off callouts and positioning from another base, all
   ranked together by what they cost.
2. Qualified substitutes, only when fewer than three own-rank crew are legal: a
   command-qualified first officer for a captain's seat, a right-seat-current captain for a
   first officer's.
3. Flying one cabin crew short, when the passengers booked still allow it.
4. Cancelling the trip's legs, always last.

Every figure an answer might read out (how much cheaper than cancelling, how many choices
cost the same, the premium of the next price) is computed here, so no model ever does sums.
