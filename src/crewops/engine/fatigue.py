"""Fatigue: legal is the floor, not the target.

The nine rules already stop the worst rosters: two clear days in every seven caps a working
block at four days, and rest of at least 12 hours (and at least the duty before it) stops
quick returns. What they allow can still wear someone out, and that is what is flagged here:

* ``early_starts``: four early starts in a row, the longest block the rules allow (caution);
* ``tight_rest``: rest that clears the minimum by less than an hour (caution);
* ``night_then_early``: an early report within 36 hours of a duty through the small hours,
  flipping the body clock from night to morning (high);
* ``repeated_nights``: a third duty through the small hours within seven days (caution), a
  fourth or more (high).

"The small hours" is 02:00 to 05:00 local, when alertness is lowest. It is narrower than the
rules' night window on purpose: an early start reporting at 05:00 is an early start, not a
night duty.

Flags never block a choice; that is the rules' job. They help a controller prefer someone
fresher, and the high ones are raised by the watch. All of it is arithmetic on the roster in
local (IST) time, with no model involved.
