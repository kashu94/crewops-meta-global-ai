"""Is this crew member legal for this trip, and if not, why not?

``assess`` is the one place the rest of the system gets a legality answer from. Before the
rules run, it applies what changes when the duty actually happens:

* Positioning. Someone based elsewhere flies in first, so day one moves until they can report.
  Positioning is duty: their day starts when they report for the positioning flight, so the
  flight counts toward the duty period and the rest before it. Later days keep their times,
  so a late first release eats into the night-stop, and the rest between the trip's own days
  is checked again.
* Reporting late. Someone called from home who cannot reach the airport by report time moves
  day one the same way.
* A what-if delay. A late departure stretches one duty day; that is how a delay pushes
  someone past a limit.

It also applies what the roster alone does not show: a standby whose window does not cover the
report time is not available, crew only fly for their own airline, and anyone reported
unavailable for a date is out on that date.
