"""How likely a crew member is to drop out of the roster in the coming days: a risk score.

Legal is a yes or no; risk is a matter of degree. Someone legal for a trip can still be
close to their weekly duty limit, on a run of early starts, two days from a lapsed medical,
or an hour's drive from the airport for a callout. Each of those adds points, and the score
says which ones did, so a controller can see why someone scores high.

The score is shown beside cover choices and on the crew record. It never ranks cover and
never rules anyone out: the rules engine alone decides who is legal, and cost alone orders
the legal choices.
