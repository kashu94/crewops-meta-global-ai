"""How urgent a problem is: high, medium or low, always with the reasons.

A controller works the most urgent problem first. Urgency here comes from three things the
engine already knows, never from a model's impression:

* **time**: how soon the affected trip reports. A seat that must be filled in the next few
  hours leaves fewer people who can get to the airport;
* **reach**: how many passengers are booked on the trip's legs;
* **room**: whether any crew member can still fill the seat, or only cancelling is left.
