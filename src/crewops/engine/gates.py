"""Gates and stands: where each departure boards, and what happens when it cannot.

A departure holds its gate from boarding (``BOARDING`` before off-block) until it leaves. A
flight loses its gate in three ways:

* the gate **closes** (a jet bridge fault, a security sweep): every departure holding it
  during the closure moves;
* the flight before it at the gate **leaves late** and is still there when boarding should
  start;
* the desk **changes** its gate to one another flight already holds.

A displaced departure goes to the first ordinary gate at the station that is free for its
whole boarding window. If none is, it takes the station's emergency gate; if that is taken
too, it boards from a remote stand by bus, which takes ``BUS_EXTRA`` longer, and that delay is
judged against crew duty like any other. Gates are tried in a fixed order and each move is
booked before the next is placed, so the same disruption always gives the same plan.
