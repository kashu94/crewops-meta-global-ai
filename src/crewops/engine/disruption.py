"""Disruptions that hold flights back: a station that closes, an aircraft out of service.

Both come down to departures leaving later than planned. Each trip is held by its first
affected leg, and that delay is judged against every rostered crew member's duty limits by
``delay_impact``, the same check a reported delay gets. Nothing is cancelled here: the result
says who would break a limit and what the delay costs, and the desk decides.

* **Station closure** (weather, a runway inspection): nothing departs the station inside the
  window, and nothing lands there, so a flight due to arrive inside it leaves its origin late
  enough to land when the station reopens.
* **Aircraft out of service** (a technical fault): every flight the tail was to fly before it
  is back leaves when it is back. Later flights that day slip by the same amount, less no
  slack: the rotation is tight.
