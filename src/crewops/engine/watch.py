"""The watch: problems in the coming days that nobody has reported yet.

Run on a schedule, it re-judges everyone rostered on every trip that has not started in the
next few days, and reports:

* ``illegal``: someone who would break a rule on a trip they are rostered on, such as a
  medical that lapses before the trip ends. Each comes with the cheapest legal cover.
* ``fatigue``: a high-severity fatigue pattern on a legal roster.
* ``certificate``: a certificate that runs out soon, before it makes anyone illegal.

The same issue keeps the same id on every run, so a scheduler can alert once and stay quiet
until it is resolved.
