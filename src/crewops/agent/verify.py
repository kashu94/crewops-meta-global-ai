"""Checking an answer against the evidence, with no model involved.

Every crew id, trip id, flight number, clock time, hour figure, count and rupee amount in the
answer must be found in what the tools returned, in the question itself, or in the rule
book's own limits. Each is checked in the forms an answer might use: ``20840``, ``20,840``
and ``₹20,840`` are one amount; ``1.75h``, ``1h45m`` and ``1 hour 45 minutes`` are one
duration.

The check is deliberately literal. It cannot judge whether a sentence is wise, only that its
facts were not invented, which is the failure that matters most when a controller acts on it.
