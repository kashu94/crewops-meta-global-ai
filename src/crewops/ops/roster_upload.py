"""Roster uploads: the next roster, or corrections to this one, as a file.

Rostering publishes in bulk. An upload is a JSON object with any of these collections, each
record in the same shape as the demo data's files (``data/seed``):

    {"crew": [...], "certificates": [...], "standby": [...], "trips": [...]}

Records replace the ones with the same identity (crew id; crew id and certificate kind; crew
id and standby date; trip id) and anything new is added. An upload never deletes.

The whole merged roster is checked before anything is written, because most mistakes only
show against other records: a trip naming a crew member who does not exist, a leg nobody
flies, two trips putting one person in two places. If anything is wrong nothing is written.
Then the rules engine judges the merged roster, and the upload reports every problem it
would add (someone over a limit, a certificate lapsing on a trip), so rostering sees what it
is about to hand the crew desk. A dry run stops there.

A trip that already exists keeps its history: its new crew list is applied as a roster change
by the person uploading, at the trip's current version, the same way a controller's change is.
