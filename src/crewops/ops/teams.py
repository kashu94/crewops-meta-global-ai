"""The teams told about a disruption besides crew control, and who is on duty in each.

A disruption rarely stops at the crew desk. A gate closure is the gate controllers' problem
first; an aircraft fault is maintenance control's; passengers on a late flight hear it from
customer care. Each team has a fixed job, and which teams a report needs follows from its
kind alone, so the list is the same every time.

Who is on duty, per station or for the whole network, is demo data
(``data/seed/contacts.json``). Email addresses are not in there: an admin subscribes them to
a team's alerts (``crewops.ops.alerts``).
