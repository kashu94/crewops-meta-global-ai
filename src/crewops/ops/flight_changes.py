"""Changes to flights themselves, made only when an approver approves them.

A controller's plan for a disruption can move flights to another aircraft (a free one of the
same type, or a spare), board them at another gate, or cancel them. Like a crew change, none
of it touches the operation when it is submitted: the plan carries the changes it would make,
the approver sees them, and they are made the moment the approver confirms. From then on the
flights show their new aircraft, gate or cancellation everywhere: the crew's own flights, the
station's operation and gates, and every check the engine makes (a cancelled flight is never
flown or used for positioning). The crew on each changed flight are told.

Holding flights to new times is not made here: a held flight's report and release belong to
its trip, and the desk retimes those as part of the plan's follow-up.
