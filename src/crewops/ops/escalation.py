"""Escalation: what the desk has left untouched goes to the duty supervisor.

Run on the same schedule as the watch. Four things escalate when nobody has acted on them
for ``UNTOUCHED`` (ten minutes):

* a plan still waiting for an approver;
* a callout with nobody left to ask, waiting for the desk's decision or its approval;
* a high-severity watch problem with no callout and no plan on its seat;
* a high-severity disruption report its desk has not started.

Each escalates once. The supervisor's notice says what is waiting, for how long, and on whose
desk, from the same records the screens read.
