"""Four eyes on every roster change.

Nothing changes a trip's crew on one person's word. A controller **submits** a plan: put this
crew member in that seat. An **approver**, never the person who submitted it, decides it:

* **approve**: the plan is judged again as the roster stands now. If its seat changed since it
  was submitted (the person it replaces is no longer in it, or the new crew member is already
  on the trip), or the crew member is no longer legal cover, the plan goes **stale** and
  nothing changes; otherwise the change is made. A change to another seat on the same trip
  does not make it stale, so the seats of one report can be approved one after another; the
  legality check at approval covers whatever else moved.
* **reject**, with a reason: the plan is closed.
* **send back**, with a note: the plan returns to the controller who submitted it, to rework.

The controller who submitted a plan may **withdraw** it until it is decided. A plan made by a
callout (someone accepted an offer) is submitted in the name of the controller who opened the
callout, so the person who approves it is always someone else.

    SUBMITTED --approve--> APPROVED       (or STALE, when the roster moved on)
