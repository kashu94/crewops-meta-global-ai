"""The scorecard: scripted crew-desk questions, run against the live models, scored by code.

    uv run python -m crewops.eval.scorecard          # writes docs/scorecard.json and .md

Each scenario says what a correct answer must do: the kind of question it is, the tools it
must use, what the answer must name, and whether it must be refused. Every scenario starts
from a fresh copy of the demo operation, so none depends on another. The results, failures
included, are published as they come out; nothing is tuned to the questions after the run.
